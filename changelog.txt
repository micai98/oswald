0.8:
  - started to make the game look more like a finished product
    - debug display is off by default (can be brought back up with the "dbg" code or F11 key)

0.7:
  - brought back old code for horizontal collision detection and tweaked its values, seems to be working for now

0.6:
  - first """fully playable""" version of the game
  - made changes to player's collision detection again
    - the horizontal collision detection now uses code similar to the vertical one, until now it was much simpler, but it would bug out too often
  - adjusted the "jump brake" to give the player more control over their jumps
  - fixed player's ability to jump despite having a block directly above them
  - countless tweaks to the camera's properties
  - added a simple title screen

  - spikes kill enemies now
  - enemies don't update while they're not visible on the screen
  - the prefab system has been improved from the last version
  - the level is now infinite and randomly generated
    - the world generator uses pre-made prefabs to generate the level
	- new prefab gets deployed automatically when the camera is about to reach the end of already existing ones
	- a 2 to 4 block gap is placed in between each prefab that's being deployed
	- there aren't many prefabs for now, and the world generator itself is rather simple. it's going to be upgraded in upcoming versions
  - the game gets rid of objects that fall behind the left border of the screen
  - small changes and fixes that I've already forgotten about



0.5:
  - added pause (press enter to pause and unpause)
  - improved the enemy's sprites
  - fixed the colors on the ground tileset 
  - started working on the world generator
    - the world generator is going to use prefabs to generate the level
	- the prefabs are stored as strings: 
	  - "." means empty space 
	  - "," means a the beginning of a new row of blocks
	  - uppercase characters represent different kinds of blocks
	  - lowercase characters represent interactive objects
	
	
	
0.4:
  - added coins, each coin gives 50 points
  - added a basic enemy
    - walks forward and turns around upon touching a wall
	- affected by gravity
	- can kill the player
	- can be killed by the player (by stomping)
	- player bounces off the enemy after stomping it and receives a 100 point bonus
	- if the player holds the jump button while stomping the enemy they'll bounce higher
	- after being stomped it changes its sprite and disappears after a few moment
  - added a filter editor that allows the player to change the game's colors
    - this one's probably getting removed or hidden, it heavily impacts the game's performance (especially on firefox)
