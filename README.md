# Oswald (Legacy)

Infinite scrolling 2d platformer written in JS
Made with Tululoo: http://www.tululoo.com/  
Available to play here: https://oswaldgame.netlify.app/  

## Info
The game has been rewritten in Godot and released on Google Play under the Rashid Division alias: https://rashiddivision.netlify.app/  
This version is obsolete and will no longer receive any updates. The JS code is also odd in many places due to Tululoo's quirks.  

The world in Oswald is infinite and randomly generated out of predefined prefabs.  
Prefabs are grouped together in prefab banks, so the generated levels are consistent in style.
There's a total of 13 prefab banks, some of which only start appearing after the player has stayed alive for long enough.  
Prefab banks feature many unique environemnts, underwater sections, vehicle sections, moving platforms and hazards, etc.
The enemies range from static obstacles, to monsters following the player through the level.
